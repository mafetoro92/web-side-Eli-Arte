Hello my friends!!!

I am happy to welcome you to my first project with React. We created our web site for a client business that sells flowers. We made two categories: one for flowers and the other for bouquets. The ide  is to show the products and if our customers are interested in buying just they need to click the "add" button to the shopping cart and then start adding in this component. When the customer is finally ready they need to go to the shopping cart and there they can find all the items they selected. They can modify their cart and when they are ready to buy there is a button that says send the order and it is connected to WhatsApp. They can have communicate with the owner and can specify the deal. 

We used React to create this project. We applied some concepts like creating components, using Routes and using some Hooks like useState, useEffect and useContext. If you want to see the deploy the project please do click in the link below.
